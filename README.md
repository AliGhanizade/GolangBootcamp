# Golang Bootcamp

This repository was created as part of my internship at **Tosee Saman** company and their amazing development team.  
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Tosee Saman** and their team for giving me this great opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.  

As the name suggests, **Golang Bootcamp** is a collection of my training projects, exercises, and experiments completed during the internship period.  
It reflects my learning journey with the **Go programming language**, covering both fundamental and practical concepts.  

All the materials are organized clearly to make it easy to explore and understand my progress throughout the bootcamp.

## Project Overview

The **Golang Bootcamp** project represents my practical journey in learning the Go programming language.  
It includes several small and medium-sized projects developed during my internship at **Tosee Saman**, where I focused on:

- Understanding Go fundamentals (syntax, data types, functions)
- Learning about Goâ€™s concurrency model using goroutines and channels
- Building real-time communication systems with **WebSocket**
- Developing RESTful APIs using the **Gin** framework
- Working with databases using **Gorm**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite**
- Writing modular, clean, and maintainable code
- Applying version control and collaboration best practices with Git

> [!TIP]
> This repository serves as both a learning record and a personal reference for future Go development.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   First, download the project to your local system using Git.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliGhanizade/GolangBootcamp.git
   cd GolangBootcamp
2. **Install dependencies**
  Use the following command to install all required Go modules.
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
3. **Run the main program**
  The main entry point of the project is located in the cmd directory.
  You can start the program by running:
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/main.go
4. **Once the program starts**, it will prompt you to enter a week number:
    ```scss
    Enter a Week(Number):
  Each week corresponds to a different Go project or exercise developed during the bootcam
