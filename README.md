# Golang Bootcamp

This repository was created as part of my internship at **Tosee Saman** company and their amazing development team.  
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to **Tosee Saman** and their team for giving me this great opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.  

As the name suggests, **Golang Bootcamp** is a collection of my training projects, exercises, and experiments completed during the internship period.  
It reflects my learning journey with the **Go programming language**, covering both fundamental and practical concepts.  

All the materials are organized clearly to make it easy to explore and understand my progress throughout the bootcamp.

## Project Overview

The **Golang Bootcamp** project represents my practical journey in learning the Go programming language.  
It includes several small and medium-sized projects developed during my internship at **Tosee Saman**, where I focused on:

- Understanding Go fundamentals (syntax, data types, functions)
- Learning about Goâ€™s concurrency model using goroutines and channels
- Building real-time communication systems with **WebSocket**
- Developing RESTful APIs using the **Gin** framework
- Working with databases using **Gorm**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLite**
- Writing modular, clean, and maintainable code
- Applying version control and collaboration best practices with Git

> [!TIP]
> This repository serves as both a learning record and a personal reference for future Go development.

## How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   First, download the project to your local system using Git.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AliGhanizade/GolangBootcamp.git
   cd GolangBootcamp
2. **Install dependencies**  
  Use the following command to install all required Go modules.

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
3. **Run the main program**  
  The main entry point of the project is located in the cmd directory.
  You can start the program by running:  
    ```bash
    go run ./cmd/main.go
4. **Once the program starts**, it will prompt you to enter a week number :  
    ```scss
    Enter a Week(Number):
  Each week corresponds to a different Go project or exercise developed during the bootcam

### Notes on Submodules
   
   To properly start the project and **get all submodules**:
   
   1. Clone the repository **including submodules**:

      ```bash
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AliGhanizade/GolangBootcamp.git
      cd GolangBootcamp
   2. If you already **cloned without submodules**, initialize and update them:

      ```bash
      git submodule update --init --recursive
> This ensures all Mini Projects (**BookStore**, **Todo** and **Algorithms**) are available and ready to use.




## Project Structure

The Golang Bootcamp repository is organized into three main sections:

|Section        | Contents / Notes |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **Algorithms**   | Exercises and practice problems to strengthen Go fundamentals and problem-solving skills. |
| **Mini Projects** | Contains two subfolders: **BookStore** and **Todo** (both are Git submodules). Important branches are already included. |
| **Weeks**     | Week folders (`week_1` to `week_6`) containing exercises and projects for each week. Some weeks include web server projects using **Gin** or **WebSocket**. |
